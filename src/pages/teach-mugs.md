**During the COVID-19 pandemic, we setup an online store to sell funny mugs for teachers.**

Whilst the majority of the UK public were placed in lockdown working remotely (if at all), our teachers continued to provide education to key workers children at serious times then the rest of school students when lockdown was eased. 

To support teachers in risky environments, we realised it would help for them to have uniquely identifiable mugs to distinguish among others in the staff room. With some silly messages on each design, it also adds some much needed laughter to raise spirits during tough times. 

The first design was our "[Keep your COVID hands off my mug](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/962873701/keep-your-covid-hands-off-my-mug?)", followed by "[Gold star for me](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/962476627/gold-star-for-me-mug?ref=shop_home_recs_4)". Eight more designs were added to the series of ten which were released for the Black Friday 2020 sales.

To reduce costs, the original store was migrated from Shopify to [Etsy marketplace](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/TeachMugs?) in early 2021 - a huge global community where potential customers are able to order their own mugs and share with friends. We've also setup [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teachmugs) and [Instagram accounts](https://www.instagram.com/teachmugs/) where we can engage and reshare customers own photos and ideas.
